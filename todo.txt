- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
- (maybe) figure out Edge bugs and how to fix (i.e. script 438, 5007 errors)
- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- onion-skin sometimes prevents resizing ability? (can't reproduce currrently :/)
- looping implementation was questionable and removed for now

- looks like reducing the number of audio nodes helps performance in terms of less latency (yay!) but I think since we reuse nodes and don't
  call stop on them for each note like we previously did, this doesn't quite make scheduling as on-point as it previously was (boooo!) and could
  introduce a bit more lag time in the scheduling. not sure if having better scheduling is more favorable to have than latency due to number of nodes.
  but tbh, the latency with the previous implementation where every note got its own oscillator node was really only noticeable if you tried to scroll
  across the page (i.e. any user activity on the page while playback occurred). it was a good exercise I guess to try anyway.

current things to do now:
	- clicking a note -> if clicking an already existing note, the volume should reflect that note's volume. otherwise use the instrument's volume.

	- bug: 2 instruments, have a note that spans 6 columns, move to next isntrument, try placing note within area that note spans. it might not let you place a new note exactly.
		- this might have to do with an existing note element (opacity is 0 b/c onion skin is off for that instrument it belongs to) in the parent cell
	- delete instrument functionality
	- delete measure functionality
	- improve percussion
	- the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
	- haven't found the exact cause yet but sometimes notes aren't getting picked up (maybe because of onion-skin) and you have to 
          delete them + re-add.
	- add metronome? is scheduler scheduling on time?
	- accessibility?
	- maybe make it at least a little mobile friendly, i.e. support also touch events?
