- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
- (maybe) figure out Edge bugs and how to fix (i.e. script 438, 5007 errors)
- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- onion-skin sometimes prevents resizing ability? (can't reproduce currrently :/)
  
current things to do now:
	- onendFunc -> don't tie it to a note but rather maybe make a silent oscillator for every column for consistency?
	- delete measure functionality
	- improve percussion
	- the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
	- haven't found the exact cause yet but sometimes notes aren't getting picked up (maybe because of onion-skin) and you have to 
          delete them + re-add.
	- work on soundmaker for custom presets
	- pre-commit hook for running tests!
