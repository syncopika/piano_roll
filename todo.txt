- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
- (maybe) figure out Edge bugs and how to fix (i.e. script 438, 5007 errors)
- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
  
current things to do now:
	- onion-skin notes shouldn't be deletable!
		- can we do a check of some sort on opacity?
		- no context-menu for them also?
		
	- importing project and then playing seems to give a slower tempo? 
	
	- move clickNote out of addNote. addNote should just be adding a note.
		- this should get rid of the click sound that occurs when importing a project also.
		
	- redo demos
