- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
- (maybe) figure out Edge bugs and how to fix (i.e. script 438, 5007 errors)
- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- onion-skin sometimes prevents resizing ability? (can't reproduce currrently :/)
  
current things to do now:
	- bug: 2 instruments, have a note that spans 6 columns, move to next isntrument, try placing note within area that note spans. it might not let you place a new note exactly.
		- this might have to do with an existing note element (opacity is 0 b/c onion skin is off for that instrument it belongs to) in the parent cell
	- delete instrument functionality
	- delete measure functionality
	- improve percussion
	- the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
	- haven't found the exact cause yet but sometimes notes aren't getting picked up (maybe because of onion-skin) and you have to 
          delete them + re-add.
	- recording needs to be fixed (stops recording too early)
