- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
- (maybe) figure out Edge bugs and how to fix (i.e. script 438, 5007 errors)
- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- onion-skin sometimes prevents resizing ability? (can't reproduce currrently :/)
  
current things to do now:
	- onendFunc -> don't tie it to a note but rather maybe make a silent oscillator for every column for consistency?
	- separate out index.html javascript
	- add a readme for with_db folder
	- redo demos
	- allow onion skin toggling (can get to be too much with multiple instruments)
