- for custom instrument presets, applying glide to a note doesn't produce the desired effect.
  - also, for custom instruments, sometimes 'play all' doesn't play a custom preset (or rather, it's silent but the blue play marker seems to work)
    This one is hard to track. I don't think it can be an async issue. check again how custom presets are being handled for the scheduler?

sometimes this error shows up with a custom preset:
playbackFunctionality.js:677 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'setTargetAtTime' on 'AudioParam': The provided float value is non-finite.

- on Firefox: when playing my demos (except for the 3/4 example), the first note always seems to be skipped.
  otherwise, performance on Firefox seems to have improved considerably from at least a year ago for my application.
  
- looping implementation was questionable and removed for now

current things to do now:
	- add panning functionality for instruments
	  - mostly works so far :D; currently does not apply to percussion instruments though
	- clicking a note -> if clicking an already existing note, the volume should reflect that note's volume. otherwise use the instrument's volume.
	- delete instrument functionality
	- delete measure functionality
	- improve percussion
	- the pianoNotes div (i.e. mobile piano bar) implementation could be cleaned up a bit maybe?
	- haven't found the exact cause yet but sometimes notes aren't getting picked up (maybe because of onion-skin) and you have to 
          delete them + re-add.
	- add metronome? is scheduler scheduling on time?
	- accessibility?
	- maybe make it at least a little mobile friendly, i.e. support also touch events?
	- refactor? things like play and stopPlay - should those be piano roll methods instead of standalone functions?
